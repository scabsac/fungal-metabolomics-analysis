# Fungal Metabolomics Data Analysis

This project is from my master's thesis, where I analyzed the complete metabolome of the necrotrophic fungi _Macrophomina phaseolina_ at 28°C and 35°C to identify differentially expressed metabolites.

_Macrophomina phaseolina_ or _Mp_ is a soil-borne fungus that infects over 500 plant species, including important commercial crops like soybean, sorghum, strawberry, and maize. Its pathogenicity interestingly increases with rising temperatures, meaning that due to climate change and rising global temperatures, this pathogen is hypothesized to play a growing role in threatening crop yields and global food security.
